This is task 1 of Prodigy InfoTech | Data Science Domain.

Create a bar chart or histogram to visualize the distribution of a categorical or continuous variable, such as the distribution of ages or genders in a population.

ðŸš€Exploring Global Population Trends: Visualizing Insights from Historical DataðŸš€
I recently analyzed a comprehensive dataset on global population trends spanning several decades. Through data visualization and analysis, I uncovered fascinating insights into population dynamics across various countries. Here are the key highlights and findings from my project.

Project Highlights:
â€¢Investigated global population data from 1960 to 2022 across multiple countries.
â€¢Used Python libraries such as pandas, seaborn, and matplotlib for data manipulation, visualization, and analysis.
â€¢Created interactive bar charts to showcase top countries by population in specific years (e.g., 1960, 2000, 2022).
â€¢Explored trends in male population distribution across different countries.
â€¢Applied data sorting and annotation techniques to enhance visual clarity and insights.

Steps Involved:
â€¢ Imported and preprocessed population data from a CSV file using Python and Pandas.
â€¢ Filtered and sorted the data to focus on total population statistics across different years.
â€¢ Visualized top ten countries with the highest population in recent years using Seaborn and Matplotlib.
â€¢ Explored demographic trends over decades through interactive bar charts and histograms.
â€¢ Analyzed and compared population dynamics globally and within specific regions.

Key Takeaway:
Exploring and visualizing historical population data offers invaluable insights into global demographic trends. This project underscores the power of data-driven insights in understanding population dynamics and their implications.
